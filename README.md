### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arati Santhanakrishnan and I'm a PhD chemical engineer turned data scientist. 

I'm currently a teaching assistant for BrainStation's data science program, and am looking for a data role that combines my burgeoning interest in machine learning with my background in engineering research and development. 

Other interests of mine are intelligent textbooks and intelligent tutoring systems.
